🛠️ Projects ()

- [CS50 Final Project: [Create a path for the ball]](https://github.com/VedantPande01/cs50-scratch-project)  
  Developed as part of **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Scratch**.  
  A [short description: e.g., “2D interactive game built in Scratch where players make way for the ball while avoiding obstacles”].  

  **Highlights:**
  - Built with Scratch’s block-based programming  
  - Includes animations, sound effects, and scoring system  
  - Designed with user-friendly gameplay mechanics  

🚧 This section will grow as I build and share my work.
